                <p>Lata has trained thousands of individuals in India and across the globe. She has taught students from
                    the United States of America, Dubai, Australia, Germany and Japan to name a few. She has conducted
                    classes from beginner to advanced Japanese (JLPT N5 to JLPT N2 course and Business Japanese course).
                    Several students who were trained by her have successfully passed JLPT N2. She has also successfully
                    conducted many corporate training programmes on Japanese language as well as business and social
                    etiquette training.<br><br>

                    Her skills as a competent translator extend to a wide range of sectors, including medicine, law,

                    Lata believes that if one wishes to connect with Japan, it is crucial to understand the culture
                    along with the language. As a result, in addition to teaching Japanese language, she also tries to
                    instil Japanese culture and manners in her students. She has played an instrumental role in
                    enhancing her student’s careers as Trainers, Translators and Interpreters and other professionals
                    working in major companies in India and in other parts of the world.<br><br>

                    Lata’s journey of learning Japanese language began in the year 2000 when she travelled to Japan.
                    Initially, she started learning Japanese to overcome the barrier of communication. Soon, the
                    language became her passion and she began studying it under the guidance of experienced Japanese
                    teachers. Throughout her five years of stay in Japan and working in Japanese organizations, she
                    became well-versed with the Japanese way of life and behavioural norms in business and social set
                    up.<br><br>

                    An Electronics Engineer by educational qualification, Lata is one amongst few who dare to pursue
                    their passion and turn it into a successful career. Her passion for Japan, Japanese language and
                    culture has moulded her into a recognized Japanese language professional.<br><br></p>

                <h2 class="text-center mt-5">Founder Statement</h2>
                <p>“The name Saachi is inspired by the word 幸 (Sachi) meaning “Happiness” in Japanese and “Truth” in
                    Hindi and Sanskrit. Both these meanings inculcate the essence of Saachi.<br>

                    Our supreme priority is to provide a happy learning experience to students by imparting the true
                    essence of Japanese language and culture. ‘Saachi’ is a tribute to my mentor and teacher, Sachiko
                    Koyanagi sensei, who taught me Japanese language and guided me to experience every aspect of
                    Japanese culture and lifestyle during my stay in Japan.<br>

                    When I moved to Japan, I did not imagine that Japanese language and culture would become such an
                    important part of my life. I had a wonderful experience while exploring Japan, not just the
                    aesthetic grandeur of the country’s incredible infrastructure and natural beauty but also the
                    profound culture and values that Japanese communities share.<br>

                    I envision to pass on the knowledge that I have acquired to all aspiring Japanese language learners
                    through Saachi.<br><br>
