                <h2>What is Culture?</h2>
                <p><i>Culture is the way of life of a group of people, including patterns of thought, beliefs,
                        behaviour,
                        customs, traditions, rituals, dress, language, art, music and literature.</i><br><br>

                    The culture of a country has significant influence on how business is conducted, as a consequence,
                    sociocultural implications are crucial for succeeding internationally. While conducting business
                    operations, a lack of multicultural sensitivity might upset potential or current clients.<br><br>

                    Communication between people from different cultures is referred to as cross-cultural communication.
                    At Saachi, we have devised an authentic cross cultural training program which will help you to
                    overcome cultural barriers and increase your awareness of social and business etiquette of Japanese
                    culture.<br><br>

                    Japan has its own set of business practices and conventions. At times, this can be a challenge for
                    foreigners as they are not privy to such behavioural norms. Our training programs will help you
                    learn and understand these norms which will ease interaction with Japanese people.<br><br>

                    Learning to connect with Japanese people is crucial as they may not always communicate directly with
                    words but make use of certain subtle gestures. This training will help you hear what is not being
                    said.<br><br></p>
