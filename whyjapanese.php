                <p>Japan, the land of rising sun that is known for its rich culture, technology, art, traditions,
                    architecture, crafts, manga, and anime. Japan boasts a huge, affluent population and a
                    well-educated, hardworking workforce, making it one of the world's leading economies. One of the
                    admirable aspects of Japan is that the country honours its history while continuing to embrace
                    modern-day advances that make the country competitive with other leading global economies.<br><br>

                    Japanese Language (Nihongo)is spoken by over 130 million people making it the ninth most widely
                    spoken language in the world. As the world's third largest economy with rapidly expanding
                    industries, the Japanese language plays an important role in social and business interactions.
                    However, the major impediment for learning Japanese language is that there is a misconception among
                    people that it is hard and is one of the most difficult languages. On the contrary, Japanese in many
                    ways is easier to learn than many other languages.<br><br>

                    Even though Japanese language has a complex grammatical system for expressing politeness and
                    formality, those who have studied it claim that the grammar is the easiest part. We would not see
                    many foreigners living in Japan knowing the language fluently and readily chatting with natives and
                    assimilating into the culture if it were difficult to learn. Additionally, grammar of Japanese
                    language is strikingly similar to most Asian languages, particularly Indian languages, making it
                    simple for Indians to learn, speak, and pursue as a vocation.<br><br></p>

                <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Why learn Japanese language?</h5>
                <p>Japan is the third largest economy in the world and is a leader in numerous sectors like automobiles,
                    consumer electronics, computers, semiconductors, textiles, aerospace, shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals
                    and many more. Currently there is a tremendous demand for Japanese language specialists across the
                    world due to growing business with Japan. Like French, German, and Spanish, Japanese is a language
                    that is not widely taught or studied although learning Japanese language can considerably increase
                    one’s professional value Learning Japanese can help you grasp the Japanese work ethic and business
                    etiquette, which will assist you to build your business ties with Japan. Both India and Japan have
                    steadily developed their relations as friendly nations over the previous few decades, resulting in
                    the expansion of their bilateral relationship. As a result, many Indian multinational corporations
                    are attempting to extend their client base, resulting in a significant surge in job opportunities in
                    Japan. Hence, to take advantage of this positive situation, learning Japanese language becomes
                    essential.<br><br>

                    In addition, aging population of Japan is a factor that is forcing the country to look for younger
                    workers around the world to sustain the growth trajectory of the country. English is not widely used
                    in Japan. Moreover, less than 30 percent of Japanese people speak English, and only around 5 percent
                    can speak English fluently. The majority of Japanese population prefer to communicate in their
                    native tongue. This has resulted in a huge demand for Japanese translators and interpreters and has
                    turned the language into one of the highest paying languages in translation and interpretation
                    world. Thus, a non- Japanese who knows the language will be in an advantageous position, will have
                    better career prospects, and will get a seamless access to Japanese industries compared to one who
                    does not know language.<br><br>

                    As the saying goes ‘Knowledge of languages is the doorway to wisdom (言語を知る ことが賢者への道)’ rightly points
                    out, if one speaks the language of the land, it gets easy to experience the culture, get to know new
                    people, and communicate better and thereby integrate into the society well.<br><br></p>
